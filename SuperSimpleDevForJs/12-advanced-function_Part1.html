    //functions are values:
    const num = 2;//just like this value '2' is stored in variable also we can store function into variable

    const function1 = function greeting_1(){
      console.log('hello2');
    }
    console.log(function1);

    //we can run function by just using variable name like this.
    function1();


    //Now you know that using only variable name u can call function so now you don't need to write fucntion name. and that is known as anonymous function.

    //But there is one pros and cons of this advance function and pro is it is shorthand and con is in normal function before function declration you can call it. whereas in this advance function you can not call function before it is decalred. bcoz now it's value and that is stored in variable.


    //we can store value(function) in object.
    const object1 = {
      num: 2,
      fun: function /*greeting*/ (){
        console.log('hello4');
      }
    };//function saved inside object it is known as method. and here also we don't need function name bcoz we can access with using object.fun(); so...
    object1.fun(); 




    //we can pass value(function) into function:
    function display(param){
      console.log(param);
    }
    display(2);//this is we passing value into function

    function run(param){
      param();
    };
    run(function() {
      console.log('hello5');
    });

    //bcoz functions are values so we can do whatever we can do with vlaues.








    //setTimeout(): this allows to run function in future. nd this is built in function

    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log('timeout');
    },3000);//setTimeout will wait for 3 sec and after that it will call the function.It takes two parameter one is function and second is time in ms.


    console.log('next line');
    //setTimeout will set timer nd it will run after 3 sec so it doesn't wait for 3sec to complete. immediately run next line and when 3sec completes it run that whatever inside of setTimeout. and this is called "Asynchronous code".

    //In synchoronous code computer wait till one line finish and after that it will go into next line.



    //setInterval():
    setInterval(function(){
      console.log('interval');
    },3000);//here also two parameter. and this function will run after 3sec in future and it will keep running after every 3sec.
    console.log('next line2');





    //Another way to loop through an array.

      'wash dishes',
      'watch youtube'
    ].forEach(function(value, index){

      if(value === 'wash dishes'){
        return;
      }//if we want to skip one of the value then we can do like this. this is same thing like we use in normal loop continue.

      //but if we want to use break then it is good idea that we use noraml for loop.

      console.log(index);
      console.log(value);
    });








    //Arrow function:

    const arrowFunction = (param, param2) => {
      console.log('arrowfunction');
      return 5;
    };//it works same as normal function and we can call using variable name.
    arrowFunction();
    


    const oneParam = /*(param)*/ param => {
      console.log(param + 1);
    };
    oneParam(5);
    //if there is only one param then we can simply skip () and direct write like this.



    // const oneLine = () =>{
    //   return 2 + 3;
    // };
    // console.log(oneLine);
    //same thing we can write like this.
    const oneLine = () => 2 + 3;
    console.log(oneLine);

      'watch youtube'
    ].forEach((value, index) => {
      console.log(value);
      console.log(index);
    });//it is better if we use arrowfunction with forEach.



    //we can ue arrow function inside objec too.
    const object2 = {
      //method: () => {

      //},
      method(){
        //this is shorthand syntax for method.
      }//we can save arrow function insdie object but it is better to use normal function inside object.
