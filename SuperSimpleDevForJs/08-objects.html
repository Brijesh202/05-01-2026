        /*JSON : Java Script Object Notation. It is basically a syntax. Similar to Object but with less feature.
        In JSON we have to write all the things in "" "key":"values" like this. Here '' is not allowed. and also function is also not allowed.
        This JSON is accepted by all other lanuage that's why we are going to use JSON and also to store data we use JSON.
