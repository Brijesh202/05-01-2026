                        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                        <p class="accent">Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
                            without the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically
                            keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
                        </p>

                <p>Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate routes close to
                    the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination.</p>

                <p>Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest
                form, making it both <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</strong></p>

                <p id="firstpara">Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, climbers of all ages can challenge themselves,
